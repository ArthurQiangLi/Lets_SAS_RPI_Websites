Here is an inline equation $a=b$. Below is not inline equation, but only one line.
\[
a = b = c.\\
f(x) = x_{\Delta}^2  + \gamma.
f(x) = \frac{numerators}{denominators}
\]

Below is multiple-line equations as \ref{e:fx}.
\begin{equation}\label{e:fx}
    f(x) = \left(\sum_a^ba+b\right)   \\ 
    x = \sin(x)
\end{equation}

Below is an example of alignment.
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= x + 5 \\
    y &= y - 8
\end{align}

Below is a table.

    \begin{tabular}{l l l}

        1 & $L_9/{2}$    & $\tau_0/2^{2/3}$    \\

        $\ldots$  & $\ldots$ & $\ldots$  \\
