1. [Apache traffic control](https://trafficcontrol.apache.org/)

   With Apache Traffic Control, operators can set up a Content Delivery Network to quickly and efficiently deliver content to their users. Traffic Control is a highly distributed, scalable and redundant solution meeting the needs of operators from small to large.

2. [Apache traffic server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/)

   Apache Traffic Serverâ„¢ software is a fast, scalable and extensible HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compliant caching proxy server. Formerly a commercial product, Yahoo! donated it to the Apache Foundation, and currently used by several major CDNs and content owners.

3. [Apache HTTP server's cache manual](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/caching.html)

   This document supplements the mod_cache, mod_cache_disk, mod_file_cache and htcacheclean reference documentation. It describes how to use the Apache HTTP Server's caching features to accelerate web and proxy serving, while avoiding common problems and misconfigurations.

4. [Apache Performance Tuning](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/perf-tuning.html)

   Apache 2.x is a general-purpose webserver, designed to provide a balance of flexibility, portability, and performance. Although it has not been designed specifically to set benchmark records, Apache 2.x is capable of high performance in many real-world situations.

5. [Apache module mod_status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html)

   The Status module allows a server administrator to find out how well their server is performing. A HTML page is presented that gives the current server statistics in an easily readable form. If required this page can be made to automatically refresh (given a compatible browser). Another page gives a simple machine-readable list of the current server state.
