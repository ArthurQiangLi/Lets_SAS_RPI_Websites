When you install **Apache2** on your Linux system and configure it to host your personal website, the following happens:

1. **Apache Daemon (httpd):**  
   Apache runs as a daemon (background process), typically called `httpd` or `apache2` (depending on the system and configuration). This daemon listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specific port, usually **port 80** for HTTP and **port 443** for HTTPS.

2. **Serving HTTP Requests:**  
   When a client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to your server's IP address or domain name:

   - The Apache daemon receives the request.
   - It parses the request to determine which file or resource the client is requesting.

3. **Returning Website Files:**  
   Apache retrieves the requested resource (like an HTML, CSS, JavaScript file, or an image) from the web root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html` on many Linux systems) and sends it back to the client as an HTTP response.

### Example Flow:

1. A browser sends a GET request to `http://your-server-ip/index.html`.
2. Apache receives the request on port 80.
3. It locates the `index.html` file in the web root directory.
4. Apache serves this file by sending it back to the client in an HTTP response.

### Key Points:

- **Daemon:** Apache is a long-running background process (daemon), ready to handle multiple incoming connections.
- **Web Root:** By default, Apache serves files from a designated directory, commonly `/var/www/html`, but this can be customized.
- **HTTP Protocol:** Apache handles the HTTP protocol, managing requests and responses as per the specifications.

If your website is working and accessible, then the daemon is indeed running and serving HTTP requests as you described. You can verify this by checking if the `apache2` service is running (e.g., using `sudo systemctl status apache2`).
